All of part ones files are located in the part1 folder
this folder contains a run.sh file that I used to start up the python cgi server.
I have completed the bonus part of the telephone database question that I put in
there own file tel-database-bonus.html and cgi-bin/tel-database-bonus.py
you can run all of them just by running the run script, opening your browser to
http://127.0.0.1:8088 and clicking on any of the html files


All of the files for part two are located in the part2 folder
you run them the same way you run all python files. './<filename>'
I have completed the bonus parts of part two as well.
It is also in its own file called temp-bonus.py
