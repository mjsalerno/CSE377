1)
	1.	Multitasking means that one user can run many programs at once.
		Multiuser means that there can be more than one user on the computer. (they don't have to be on at the same time)
		So one users files can not be changed to any other users without permission. Linux is a multiuser operating system
		because you can see that when we use the who command there are many people logged in.
		there are also file permissions that don't allow other users to edit other users files.

	2.	Two systems programs: Linux and Windows
		Two application programs: Sublime Text and wireshark, OS is Fedora Linux

	3.	Three UNIX variants: Linux, BSD, GNU Hurd
		Three Linux Distributions: Fedora, Arch, Slackware

2)
	1.	When you first login it puts you in csh (env says SHELL=/bin/csh)
		but I type bash to use bash instead.

	2.	You can use the date command in both bash and csh

	3.	I was born on Dec 27th, 1990
		I used the command 'cal 1990 -m dec' and it prints out a calender
		for the month of December in the year of 1990.
		I was born on a Thursday.

	4.	ssh <username>@<hostname> -p <port>
