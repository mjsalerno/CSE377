1)
	1.	Multitasking means that one user can run many programs at once.
		Multiuser means that there can be more than one user on the computer. (they don't have to be on at the same time)
		So one users files can not be changed to any other users without permission. Linux is a multiuser operating system
		because you can see that when we use the who command there are many people logged in.
		there are also file permissions that don't allow other users to edit other users files.

	2.	Two systems programs: Linux and Windows
		Two application programs: Sublime Text and wireshark, OS is Fedora Linux

	3.	Three UNIX variants: Linux, BSD, GNU Hurd
		Three Linux Distributions: Fedora, Arch, Slackware

2)
	1.	When you first login it puts you in csh (env says SHELL=/bin/csh)
		but I type bash to use bash instead.

	2.	You can use the date command in both bash and csh

	3.	I was born on Dec 27th, 1990
		I used the command 'cal 1990 -m dec' and it prints out a calender
		for the month of December in the year of 1990.
		I was born on a Thursday.

	4.	ssh <username>@<hostname> -p <port>

3)
	1.	There are eight immediate subdirectories 
		'ls -l'
		total 112
		drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 36864 2014-04-09 13:29 bin
		drwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 2011-10-12 10:29 games
		drwxr-xr-x  35 root root  4096 2011-10-12 10:30 include
		drwxr-xr-x 190 root root 36864 2014-04-09 13:26 lib
		drwxr-xr-x  11 root root  4096 2014-04-08 21:14 local

		drwxr-xr-x   4 root root  4096 2011-10-12 10:30 src

		there are 12305 total subdirectories
		'ls -lR | grep total | wc'
		 12305   24615  105825

		2.	'mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3'
			'ls -l'
			total 12
			drwxr-xr-x 2 mijsalerno fuse 4096 2014-04-24 12:52 dir1
			drwxr-xr-x 2 mijsalerno fuse 4096 2014-04-24 12:52 dir2
			drwxr-xr-x 2 mijsalerno fuse 4096 2014-04-24 12:52 dir3

			this means the owner can read, write, or execute the file
			users in the same group as me can only execute and read
			everyone else can only execute

		3.	'echo hello > hi'
			'echo bye > bye'
			'cat hi'  		//this prints out one file
			'cat hi bye' 	//prints out both files
