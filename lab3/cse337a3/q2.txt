Question 2 all parts

What would the following regular expressions match or do? Be precise, complete, and give 
reasons. For each pattern, give two good example strings to illustrate your answer. Note that 
good means it is as general and different from other examples as possible. 


(1) /”([^”]*)”/ (6pts) Note that in the pattern, ” is a double-quote. 

	This matches any part of a string that has a " followed by any number of ^ and "
	followed by another "

	" 		matches the " character
	[^"]* 	matches any number of * and ^

	 matching           non-matching 
	---------- 	        ------------ 
	 ""^^""^"" 	             "^  
	    """       	         ^" 


(2) /^\b[\w.]{2,9}\b$/ (6pts) 

	this matches any word between 2 and 9 letters and dots long
	that are enclosed in a word boundary

	^\b   	means begins with word boundry
	[\w.] 	means match any word char or .
	{2,9} 	means match the thing behind it 2 - 9 times
	\b$   	means end in word boundry

	matching              non-matching   
	-------- 	          ------------   
	hello    	           helllllllo   
	bye      	           b   

(3) s/(\w+)(\s)+(\w+)/\3\2\1/ (6pts)
	
	this takes two words at the beginning of the line and swaps them.
	a b c would become b a c
	dog cat would become cat dog
	it also makes more than one space just one spaces in between
	the first and second word.

	s/    substitution
	(\w+) one or more word chars
	(\s)+ one or more space char

	\3\2\1 (i think it should be $3$2$1) takes what matched the 
		   third group and puts it befor what matched the second group, 
		   then puts what matched the first group after that.
