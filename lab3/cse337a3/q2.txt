Question 2 all parts

What would the following regular expressions match or do? Be precise, complete, and give 
reasons. For each pattern, give two good example strings to illustrate your answer. Note that 
good means it is as general and different from other examples as possible. 


(1) /”([^”]*)”/ (6pts) Note that in the pattern, ” is a double-quote. 

	This matches any part of a string that has a " followed by any number of ^ and "
	followed by another "
